# UserAdderPS1
Script PowerShell for adding user in Active Directory from a txt file.
If one or more OU don't exist, then the script will create them

You juste have to follow the exemple.txt file to make the input file.

For "*$rootOU = "OU=Domain Controllers,DC=domain,DC=local"*" if needed you have to add "*OU=Organisation,*" for exemple
